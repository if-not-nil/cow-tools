use lua code to test your apis  
<img width="710" alt="to save" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ae13dfa-0a8f-48fb-bde0-10ccb2873db9" />

*features:*
- any valid lua code can make requests
- use fzf to go through requests
- it's kinda pretty
- small and easy to modify if something doesn't work
- it's easier to fully understand than similar tools

*installation:*
you need curl installed and available in $PATH  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/if-not-nil/cow-tools
cd cow-tools
echo alias cows='"'lua $(pwd)/main.lua'"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
if you don't want to install it, just running `lua absolute/path/to/main.lua` is alright  
the last line makes a bash alias for you

you should probably have an lsp as the type hints in types.d.lua will help you a lot

*usage:*\
make a lua file  
this is the simplest thing you can set up to make sure it's working  
```lua
# first.lua
---@type request[]
return {
	{
		url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1",
		method = "GET",
	},
}
```
this does just what you think it does
now, run `cows first.lua 1`  
<img width="734" alt="placeholder" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bf85b8c-974c-41cf-b540-c77828059170" />  
that's right, you're balling now
now, if you have fzf, just run `cows first.lua`  
it's not colorized or anything yet, but it helps you keep up with the requests you have

here's a better example
```lua
# first.lua
-- this is just lua, so you can do whatever.
-- this, for example, is a global variable
local URL = "http://localhost:1323"

-- this here is an dynamic variable. a `store = {}` table saves them to a file nearby
local AUTH = "Authorization: Bearer {{TOKEN}}"
-- for normat env vars, use os.getenv

-- the request table needs to be returned as per types.d.lua
-- if you don't have a language server for lua, i highly recommend you install one
---@type request[]
return {
	{
		url = URL .. "/auth/refresh",
		method = "GET",
		headers = {
			AUTH,
		},
	},
	{
		url = URL .. "/auth/register",
		method = "POST",
		body = {
			-- refer to the first line. i run your functions every
			-- time you look at them for the clarity of your code, too
			-- user = "user_" .. math.random(0, 1000),
			user = os.getenv("XDG_CONFIG_HOME") or "",
			password = function()
				local charset = {}
				for _ = 1, 12 do
					table.insert(charset, string.char(math.random(48, 122)))
				end
				return table.concat(charset)
			end,
		},
		save = {
      -- saves to a file next to this one, if your file is requests.lua, it'll be saved to requests_var.lua
			token = "TOKEN",
		},
	},
	{
		url = URL .. "/auth/login",
		method = "POST",
		body = {
      -- gets CUR_USER from [filename]_var.lua
			name = "{{CUR_USER}}",
			password = "{{CUR_PASSWORD}}",
		},
	},
}

```

*HOW I WANNA DO IT WITOUT FZF NEXT:*\
request names would either be user-specified or autogenerated

*WHY COW TOOLS:*\
lua -> moon -> moo, and then tools\
i feel like Cow Tools, the comic strip represents lua well. it really is that simple, no need to overthink it\

*CONTRIBUTING:*
