# cow tools
> no, the moon

i didn't like bruno so i built something people like me would appreciate.\
its main feature is the way it takes advantage of LuaLS\


*WORK IN PROGRESS*!!! only the basic functionality works.

*INSTALLATION:*
`git clone https://github.com/if-not-nil/cowtools`\
you need curl installed and available in $PATH\
you can go far without a plugin for lua in your editor, but it's the intended way to use it

*USAGE:*\
lua main.lua [requests.lua]

*TODO:*
* add some pictures to the readme
* let the user set the file in an environment variable
* make it not use fzf by default, but act more unix-y. no args lists requests, and the arg after the filename would be autogenerated   

*COPYRIGHT NOTICES:*
* rxi/json MIT

*HOW I WANNA DO IT WITOUT FZF NEXT:*\
request names would either be user-specified or autogenerated

*WHY COW TOOLS:*\
lua -> moon -> moo, and then tools\
i feel like Cow Tools, the comic strip represents lua well. it really is that simple, no need to overthink it\

*CONTRIBUTING:*
if you find yourself confused by something - make an issue and i'll add it to the documentation. if you figure it out yourself - make a pull request or an issue.\
any contributions are welcome
